        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>Page Three (stylized <strong class="red">page_3</strong>) is a secret online "newsletter" and life update
            platform created by Xander
            Munc (you might know him) as a place to store ideas, share thoughts and current projects, and provide life
            updates that might not come up otherwise. Designed to be shared only with his close friends, its goal is to
            <i class="blue">keep his loop in the loop</i> (even if it's never read).
        </p>

        <h2>How to find it</h2>
        <p>Page Three can be found in a few ways:
        <ol>
            <li>1. Navigating to <i class="blue">xandermunc.art/page_3</i> directly.</li>
            <li>2. Navigating to <a href="https://xandermunc.art/">xandermunc.art</a> on a large screen device and
                entering the
                number <<strong class="red">3</strong>>.</li>
            <li>3. Navigating to <a href="https://xandermunc.art/">xandermunc.art</a> on a mobile device and pressing
                the word
                <strong class="red">"soon"</strong> in the line <strong class="red">"website coming soon"</strong>.
            </li>
        </ol>
        </p>

        <h2>How to keep it a secret</h2>
        <h4>Written by XM and his team of creatives*</h4>
        <img src="ambigram.png" />
        <p>Page Three can be kept a secret in many ways but here are a few of our favorites:
        <ol>
            <li>1. Write the url in a food-safe writing medium of your choice (sauce, food dye, food coloring markers,
                ect)
                on the inside of a sandwich or foldable consumable. As long as the url is concealed
                within, you are keeping it a secret. As a bonus measure consume the meal to be sure the secret is
                thoroughly kept.</li><br>
            <li>2. Create a 3 dimensional <a href="https://2catteam.github.io/AmbigramGenerator/">ambigram</a> that
                displays any 5
                character line of your choice from the front, and the title '<strong class="red">page_3</strong>' from
                the side. Then imbed the
                ambigram into a solid physical surface so that the word or phrase of your choice is displayed from the
                front. As long as the title is hidden in the physical world, and your chosen phrase is not revealing to
                the other dimension of content, you are keeping it a secret.</li><br>
            <li>3. Write the line "<i class="blue">I know a secret you don't know</i>" followed by your name on a piece
                of paper. Gather
                tree seeds from a local park or wood (acorns, pine nuts, samaras, or any kind will do). Place the seeds
                on top of the paper then roll the paper into a tightly kept cylinder with the seeds concealed inside.
                Dig a hole in the woods relative to the size of the seed (1/4 to 1/2 of an inch deep for small seeds, 1
                to 2 inches deep for medium seeds, and 2 to 3 inches deep for larger seeds.) and place the paper roll
                inside. Then water the spot thoroughly to ensure the soil is evenly attended to. Wait a few weeks or few
                months to see the sapling germinate depending on soil quality, water, temperature, and light. And in a
                few years you will have a tree to keep the secret for you, thus properly keeping it a secret. </li><br>
            <li>4. Don't tell anyone. By not telling anyone you are keeping it a secret.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>How to use Page Three</h2>
        <h3>1. Updates</h3>
        <p>Page Three is not updated on a schedule. Which means you'll have to check periodically to see if it is
            updated. Or, if you know XM in real life (you probably do) you can ask him directly. Here are a few ways to
            try:</p>
        <ol>
            <li> 1. "Hey X is that stupid page you texted me a while ago updated?"
            </li><br>
            <li>2. <i class="blue">In a letter</i> "Dearest Xander, your content on page_3 astonished my mind
                and tantalized my senses. When,
                oh, when will more delectable articles be published for me to enjoy?"</li><br>
            <li>3. "–û–±–Ω–æ–≤–ª—è–µ—Ç—Å—è –ª–∏ –≤–∞—à–∞ –ª–∏—á–Ω–∞—è —Ä–∞—Å—Å—ã–ª–∫–∞?"</li>
        </ol><br>
        <p>
            The "<i class="blue">Updates section</i>" at the top of the newsletter might include the line "<i
                class="blue">new material</i>" from time to
            time.
            This only appears for the first few days after content is updated. If you would like to view previous
            uploads
            (of which there are currently none) X will work on a way to view archived versions in the future.
        </p>
        <h3>2. Links</h3>
        <p>Links are stylized as un-italicized blue words like this: <a href="https://example.com/">link</a> <a
                href="https://www.iana.org/domains/reserved">link</a> <a
                href="https://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html">link</a>.
            When viewed on desktop devices they will hover <i class="yellow">yellow</i>. And when selected on any device
            they will navigate
            the user to the referenced url.
        </p>
        <h3>3. Special interactivity</h3>
        <p>Audience members who view these articles from a desktop or device with mouse interactivity will find that
            they can <i class="blue">move the article frame</i> itself. An interaction not available to mobile viewers
            (or on desktop safari (idk why)).
        </p>
