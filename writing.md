## About 

Page Three (stylized **page_3**) is a hidden online "newsletter" and life update platform created by Xander Munc (you might know him) as a place to store ideas, share thoughts and current projects, and provide life updates that might not come up otherwise. Designed to be shared only with his close friends, its goal is to *keep his loop in the loop* (even if it's never read). 

## How to find it

Page Three can be found in a few ways:
    1. Navigating to *xandermunc.art/page_3* directly.
    2. Navigating to [xandermunc.art](https://xandermunc.art/) on a large screen device and entering the number **<3>**.
    3. Navigating to [xandermunc.art](https://xandermunc.art/) on a mobile device and pressing the word **"soon"** in the line **"website coming soon"**.

## How to keep it a secret 
#### Written by XM and his team of creatives*

Page Three can be kept a secret in many ways but here are a few of our favorites:
    1. Write the url in a food-safe writing medium of your choice (sauce, food dye, food coloring markers, ect) on the inside of a sandwich or foldable consumable. As long as the url is concealed within, you are keeping it a secret. As a bonus measure consume the meal to be sure the secret is thoroughly kept. 
    2. Create a 3 dimensional [ambigram](https://2catteam.github.io/AmbigramGenerator/) that displays any 5 character line of your choice from the front, and the title '**page_3**' from the side. Then imbed the ambigram into a solid physical surface so that the word or phrase of your choice is displayed from the front. As long as the title is hidden in the physical world, and your chosen phrase is not revealing to the other dimension of content, you are keeping it a secret. 
    3. Write the line *"I know a secret you don't know"* followed by your name on a piece of paper. Gather tree seeds from a local park or wood (acorns, pine nuts, samaras, or any kind will do). Place the seeds on top of the paper then roll the paper into a tightly kept cylinder with the seeds concealed inside. Dig a hole in the woods relative to the size of the seed (1/4 to 1/2 of an inch deep for small seeds, 1 to 2 inches deep for medium seeds, and 2 to 3 inches deep for larger seeds.) and place the paper roll inside. Then water the spot thoroughly to ensure the soil is evenly attended to. Wait a few weeks or few months to see the sapling germinate depending on soil quality, water, temperature, and light. And in a few years you will have a tree to keep the secret for you, thus properly keeping it a secret. 
    4. Don't tell anyone. By not telling anyone you are keeping it a secret.

## How to use Page Three
### 1. Updates

Page Three is not updated on a schedule. Which means you'll have to check periodically to see if it is updated. Or, if you know XM in real life (you probably do) you can ask him directly. Here are a few ways to try: 
    1. "Hey X is that stupid page you texted me a while ago updated?"
    2. *In a letter* "Dearest Xander, your content on page_3 astonished my mind and tantalized my senses. When, oh, when will more delectable articles be published for me to enjoy?"
    3. "–û–±–Ω–æ–≤–ª—è–µ—Ç—Å—è –ª–∏ –≤–∞—à–∞ –ª–∏—á–Ω–∞—è —Ä–∞—Å—Å—ã–ª–∫–∞?"

The *"Updates section"* at the top of the newsletter might include the line *"new material"* from time to time. This only appears for the first few days after content is updated. If you would like to view previous uploads (of which there are currently none) X will work on a way to view archived versions in the future. 

### 2. Links 

Links are stylized as un-italicized blue words like this: [link](https://example.com/) [link](https://www.iana.org/domains/reserved) [link](https://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html). When viewed on desktop devices they will hover yellow. And when selected on any device they will navigate the user to the referenced url. 

### 3. Special interactivity

Audience members who view these articles from a desktop or device with mouse interactivity will find that they can *move the article frame* itself. An interaction not available to mobile viewers.
